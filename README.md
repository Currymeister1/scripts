# Some Python Scripts

Just trying out python and automating process to boost productivity ;)

## Download File Manager
Sorting the files in Download folder into different sub folders based on the file type. Currently, there are four sub categories:    
1. PDFs 
2. Images (jpeg, png)
3. Videos (mp4, mov, wmv, avi, gif)
4. Documents (doc, docx, odt, rtf, tex, txt, wpd)  

For windows users: You need to change the myPath variable.



## How To Automatically Run The Script
You can use incrontab, which is available on most linux distors ([Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Incron)). You will need **IN_CREATE** and **IN_MOVE_TO**  mask types
